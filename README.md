### What I find interesting

Although the article is dated a year ago, I find it interesting because it really highlights the need for AI related developers. As seen from the graph data in the middle of the page, when ChatGPT took the world by surprised at the end of 2022, the demand for generative AI related jobs increased severely. Those demands then got absorbed but bounced back up even higher post 2023. What the graph and the article realy convey is that as companies figured out ways to implement and utilize technology like ChatGPT, they needed developers to help implement those ideas. But since demand far outpace supply, incentives are high to attract those who are skilled.
